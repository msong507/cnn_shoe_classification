3. Key Words: CNN, DenseNet201, ResNet151V2, Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation, Early Stopping, Regularization, Overfitting

# Goal of Analysis
Product categorization is currently a manual, labor-intensive task. This process is not only time-consuming and costly, but it is also subject to inaccuracies arising from subjective interpretation of product images and human error. These inaccuracies can subsequently impact customer satisfaction and sales negatively. 
We aim to develop a deep neural network model for product image classification, initially focusing on shoe images. By automating the categorization task, we anticipate significant gains in efficiency and accuracy, as well as substantial cost reductions, revolutionizing our current process in the fashion industry.
